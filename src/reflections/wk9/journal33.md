# Capstone Reflection

**What technologies and principles are you using in your project?**

We decided to use Firebase in our project to upload videos and images. We used the SOLID prinicles as well as injection dependency. 

**What went well so far?**

Our team work and planning has gone very well. We have a very good skeleton of the front end. 

**What would you do differently? Why?**

I would make sure to check other's work a bit more. I ended up finding Issues in the back end I needed to go back and fix.
