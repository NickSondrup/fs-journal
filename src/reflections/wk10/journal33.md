#  C# Data Types 

**What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?**

Value types hold the actual data value, 
Reference types store where the value can be found,
pointer types holds a memory address of another type. 

**What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?**

string, char, int, float, decimal, bigInt tinyInt, bool, boolean, array, lists, ect. 

I've noticed that C#'s data types are much more specific than JavaScript

**In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?**

Reference types don't techically get stored in memory but hold an address/pointer that tells where the data is being stored, unlike Value types which are actually stored in memory.
