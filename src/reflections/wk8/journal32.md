# Testing in Vue

**What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?**

Unit testing, Component testing, End to End testing

**What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?**

I feel component testing is the most useful because it seems the most effecient. You don't need to stop a test every single unit of code but should stop thing's once things start getting intertwined to catch bugs early. 

**What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?**

I find unit testing the least useful, while i still think it has a place in my tool belt I'll often find any issues I would have found in unit testing when component testing.
