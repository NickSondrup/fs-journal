# Frames on the wire

**What is the purpose of wire-framing?**

To help developer and or client figure out what element's they want and where they should be on the webpage. They are effective as a blueprint or guide for building the page and can help developers bridge the jargon page with clients. 

**What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?**

*Low-Fidelity*: The roughest draft can even be pen and paper. Used as a very quick mock and is not 100% precise to where elements will be.

*Mid-Fidelity*: The most often used. Is an accurate representation of the final product but lacks detail's styling, and often functionality. 

*High-Fidelity*: The most detailed. Often made with tools like Figma, these mocks are not just accurate but have most details and even actual images. 

**Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?**

While wire-frames can take some time to set up (but less so thanks to Mick) I do think they are worth the effort in most situations. I think it's crucial for the developer and or client to have a solid idea of what they are going to make before starting the project.
