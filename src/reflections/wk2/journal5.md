# VAR, LET, and CONST

**What is Scope?**

The scope of the variable is where the variable can be uses. Ex: globally scoped compared to function/locally scoped.

**What is Hoisting?**

Hoisting is where you place your variables at the top of their scope. This allows variables to always be accessed. 

**In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?**

Var is helpful if you want to initialize a variable as undefined. let is the most common because it is block scoped, meaning it can't be redeclared in the same scope. const is useful if you want a variable that is impossible to change.
