#  C# Enum's

**What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?**

Enums are strongly typed contants. They are unique types that allow you to attach names to values. Enums can help make writing your code easier because the allow you to set any value to something like a key. So if you need to write a lengthy over and over again instead you can just use a single charater key. 

**How can you modify an Enum?**

You can change its base type and memver values, you can also set the value of an enum member.

**How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)**

Enums could have been useful in rock paper scissors to help communicate the selections.
