# Partner Project Reflection

**Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?**

My partner and I may not have used a true pair programming approach but we did often go back and look at each others work to get a second eye on things as well as we made sure we both worked all over the application so we knew how things were working.

**What went well?**

We divided the tasks up very well and were often surprised by the amount of ground the two of us could cover together. We also helped catch each other's errors and made sure we kept our process's insync.

**What would you do differently?**

I think we could have planned better. We both had the approach of lets try it first and make a plan later and that slowed us down when we ran into error's that were written long before.
