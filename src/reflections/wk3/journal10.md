# Encapsulating Encapsulation

**What is the purpose of Encapsulation?**

Encapsulation allows developers to keep private functions and data away from the user. It also helps orginize code and helps keep things to a single purpose. 

**What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?**

The underscore prefix convention seems to be a bad convention because few people impliment it, and it doesnt prove true security like encapsulation does. Closure can have issues with scope.

**How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?**

By encapsulating it inside of the appstate through controller and service files. We do this so our data will be impossible to manipulate through the files we make public.
