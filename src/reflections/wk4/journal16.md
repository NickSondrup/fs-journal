# Don't rest on REST

**What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?**

REpresentational State Transfer, which means when the API is called the server will transfer a representation of the state of the requested resource. 

**What does Stateless mean?**

Stateless means the server doesn't remember the user, if the user has sent any GET requests, or which resources the user requested before.

**What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?**
