**What are lifecycle hooks used for?**

Lifecylce hooks are used in a similar way listener's are used (they actually might even be listeners?). They allow you change information on the page dynamically without having to redraw all infromation 

**What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?**

Mounting hooks allow you to immediately access your component before and after the first render. Use mounting hooks if you want to get data from your component immediately.
