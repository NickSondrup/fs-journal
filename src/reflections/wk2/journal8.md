**What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?**

Planning before writing code can help you code more efficiently and can help you avoid running into problems with your code in the future. For example if you are adding to an application someone has already build, it helps to plan a research exactly what their code is doing so you don't accidently break the whole system.

**How do you find answers when you are stuck?**

The internet. Using google or other search engines to find the answer can save you precious time. You're employer isn't paying you to write code someone else has written. 

**From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?**
