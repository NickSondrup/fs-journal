# Calling back Callback Hell

**What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?**

Callback Hell is caused when people try to write code in a way where it will execute from top to bottom. a sign is overly large and overly complicated functions and operations.

**What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?**

asynchronous means not in synch or in other words not in time. Callbacks are involved by taking time to return a result instead of it immediatly returning. 

**Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell**

Keep your code shallow, if you are making overly complex functions something is wrong. Modularize, keep like things with eachother and keep them small then add them together to make something larger. Handle every single error, it's best to work in small states of done so you can test often and debug quickly.
