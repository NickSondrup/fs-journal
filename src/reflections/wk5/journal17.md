# a Query on Query Parameter's

**What is the purpose of a Query String?**

A query string allows you to pass information back and forth from a website by adding that information to the URL. 

**What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?**

?key=value. It starts with a question mark and different parameter's can be seperated by the & symbol. 

**When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?**

Query parameters can be useful when user's are inputing information, especially different types of info from something like a form.
