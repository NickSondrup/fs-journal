# Cheating at Design

**What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?**

I found the idea of using font weight and color to control your hierarchy intresting, as well as using shadow boxes instead of borders. 
Also the idea of keeping icons small that were meant to be small and enclosing them inside shapes to make them seem larger.

**Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.**

https://fontawesome.com/ (have used before)

**How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?**

I think a well designed site can greatly incease the appeal of any products as well as incease the chance of people returning to the site. Also a well designed site can increase its accessibilty and decrease user error.
