I'm so excited to have learned all this and am ready to dive into the real world of software development but I am also incredibly sad that my time at Codeworks may be coming to and end in a few weeks. I say may because I actually hope I can be considered as a TA here. But I am also pretty nervous with the final coming up but I feel very confident about it. I'm still taking more serious than I ever taken a test before. But I can say for sure that Codeworks has gotten me to the confidently compitent stage. With being able to learn C# within a week and write a whole API with it I feel like I can trust myself to learn any new language or technology that would be required in my future career.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=o.exports}}]);
