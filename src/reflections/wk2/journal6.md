**What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?**

Function Declarations, Function Expressions, Arrow Function Expressions. Function Declarations are hoisted unlike the others which makes them usually the most useful.

**What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?**

Parameter's are used when defining a function. Arguments are the value put into the function in place of the parameters.

**What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?**

A higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as a parameter or returns another function.
