# ES6 Modules

**What problem does using exports solve?**

exporting and importing stops the user from accessing data or functions that the developer does not want them accessing. This can increase security and or stop users from cheating. 

**How does export differ from export default?**

with normal export you can have multiple named exports per file and then split them up where you want them to go. With default it exports them all as one.

**What is a benefit of using the Module System?**

Code can be split into bite sized files for easier debugging and understanding. It also helps with orginization and to keep the users fingers out of the functions and variables they shouldn't be able to access.
