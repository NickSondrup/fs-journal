# Base64 Images

**What is a Base64 Encoded Image?**

a Base64 Encoded Image is an image converted into HTML so that it can be delivered directly to the page. 

**What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?**

It will increase the download size, and will take up CPU processing power, and needs to make fetch requests that may be unnecessary.

**Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?**

These are draw back's today because our systems are so much more powerful today that it's much easier to download files like images directly.
