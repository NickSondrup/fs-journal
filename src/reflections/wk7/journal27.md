# Designing a User Experience

**What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?**

A UX or user experience is the interaction your application has with the people who use it. An important thing to remember when developing a UX is who is the target of the application and how do you want them to interact with it.

**What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?**

Some benefits are that user's will be more likely to come back/recommend your application and it could also mean user's run into less error's. 

**Why is the User Experience important?**

User experience is important because if there aren't any user's there isn't really an application. If a tree falls in the woods and now one is there to hear it does it make a sound?
