# Lists in C#

**What is a List in C#?**

A List is an object that stores variables of a certian type in a specific order. 

**What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?**

I will probably be using the .Remove() and .Add() a good amount. I can also see .Clear(), .Contains(), .Find(), and a bunch of others. Here's a good link to find them. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=net-5.0

**How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?**

I think .Find() could work, but it only retrieves the first item that matches the value.
