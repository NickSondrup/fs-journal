**What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?**

pseudo-class's are used to define a specific state of an element.
example 
:hover 
:checked
:disabled

**What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?**

Specificity determines what styles can over ride others. The higher the specificity the stronger the override is. You can use this to your advantage in many ways, like applying a certain style to most the page but apply a higher specificity to elements you want to be styled differently. 

**What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?**

One problem you could run in to is the !important tag can override styles you wanted. Also if you use it too often the !important tag to often it can render a large section of your style sheet useless.
