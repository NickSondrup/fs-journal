# Welcome to SQL

**In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?**

information in a row is an actual instance saved in the table whereas the information in the column shows what properies the instance's can hold inside that table. 

**Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id.**

Table Characters

|int age|  varchar name  |  description   |   id  |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------|
|   10  |      Jim       |  brown hair    |   1   |
|   11  |      Bob       |  blue eyes     |   2   |
|   9   |      Joe       | tall and skinny|   3   |

**What is the difference between the following statements:**

**DELETE FROM table_name;** This statement is used to find a specific row and delete it form the table.

**DROP TABLE table_name;** This statement is used to completely delete the entire table.
