**Why do we use git?**

Git allows multiple developers to be able to access the same code and work paralell. This allows them to make sure their code doesn't conflict with others and can also act as a safe place to store code incase hardware or software issues.

**What is the benefit of having multiple Branches?**

Multiple branches allow the developer(s) to work paralell to the main branch. This helps developers test code before merging it the main branch and also helps when multiple developers are working on the same project. 

**What is the difference betweeen Git and GitHub?**

Git is a local repository, the program downloaded on the computer. Github is a remote repository, the all knowing cloud.
